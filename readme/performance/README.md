# 🏎️ Performance

{% hint style="warning" %}
PurrNet has yet to do much active performance optimization. All results seen below are prior to most attempts at bettering performance, and it should only improve for future updates.
{% endhint %}

We do our best to run non-biased tests, also meaning that we don't pick tests from what PurrNet will excel at, but rather tests that are relevant to users of network solutions. We do our best at sharing the method used for testing as well as the tool used for tracking the bandwidth usage.

## Average of all tests

This currently includes data from the [RPC Benchmarks](performance.md) and [Network Transform Benchmarks](network-transform-benchmarks.md). This is purely an average of how PurrNet compares to other systems, so see the individual articles for more accurate representations.

* **PurrNet vs. FishNet** → **49.00% lower usage**
* **PurrNet vs. Mirror** → **55.67% lower usage**
* **PurrNet vs. NetCode** → **72.56% lower usage**
