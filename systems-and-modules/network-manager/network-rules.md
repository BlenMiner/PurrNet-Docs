# Network Rules

Network Rules are some of the most uniquely useful features of PurrNet. These allow for you to fully customize your networking experience for the easiest possible workflow or full server auth to ensure a cheat free experience.

You can make your own network rule-set, but PurrNet also comes pre-packaged with some. In most cases, you won't need any more than these. If you want the best/easiest possible development loop, you should go for the "Unsafe" rule-set. This allows for the most freedom as a developer. If you want it to act as most networking systems with full server authority, you should select the "ServerStrict". However, the "ServerOwner" will also allow a great deal more flexibility, without great cost of cheating.

The rules are pretty self-explanatory if you take a look at the scriptable. It will allow you to adjust things such as (but not exclusive to):

* Authorization to spawn and despawn
* The default owner
* How ownership acts when given
* Who can assign ownership
* Who is responsible of synchronizing values
* And much more.
