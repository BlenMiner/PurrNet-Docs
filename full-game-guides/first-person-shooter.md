# ðŸ”« First Person Shooter

The whole series is out as a video, and more videos can be added in the future, so keep an eye on the playlist.

The series takes you through a bunch of steps:

* Setting up PurrNet
* Creating your character networked with inverse kinematics/rigging
* Using the networked state-machine to control game states & weapon switching
* Setting up a lobby and integrating Steam
* And much more!

So get started by watching the videos, following along and remember to ask any questions in the comments or in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HnNKdkq9ta)
