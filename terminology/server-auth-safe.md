# Server Auth (Safe)

Server Auth or "Safe", are referencing the opposite of the [Client Auth](client-auth-everyone-unsafe.md) option. This ensures that you as the developer are forced to take cheat safe routes with your development, similar to how other systems do it, like NetCode, Mirror or Fish-Net.
