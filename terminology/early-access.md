# Early Access

Early Access for PurrNet means that only paying members have access to these features **for now**. Full free access will come, but for now it's a closed forum. This is typically because the feature is still being thoroughly tested. We'll do our best to avoid completely unusable and non-production viable products to enter early access.\
\
Early access allows us to test new features in a more controlled environment, and avoid having to spend too much time publicly supporting something that we know isn't fully ready. This is to avoid us having to lose time, so we can focus on creating the best possible features for you!
