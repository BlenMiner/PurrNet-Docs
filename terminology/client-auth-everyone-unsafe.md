# Client Auth/Everyone (Unsafe)

Client Auth, "Everyone" and Unsafe, are words used over and over again throughout PurrNet. It is important to understand that this isn't inherently "bad", just because the word "unsafe" is involved. It will simply mean that the code isn't cheat proof, and for most games such as Co-op, friendly games or casual games, this isn't relevant either.

Allowing for unsafe networking in your [Network Rules](../systems-and-modules/network-manager/network-rules.md) will make life for you as a developer even easier with PurrNet, allowing you to cut corners at every step of the way!

If the rules are not set to unsafe, you'd have to ensure that the calls are happening through the server, and ensure a safe code structure yourself.
