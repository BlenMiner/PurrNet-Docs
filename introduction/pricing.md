# ðŸ’² Pricing

**PurrNet** is 100% free and will remain 100% free. This means, no core features behind a paywall, no premium version or anything like that. We do not expect anything from you.&#x20;

* No revenue sharing
* No up-front cost
* No credits (but appreciated)

We also allow tool creators to be part of our [asset library](addon-library.md), at no cost or revenue sharing.

If anything is paid, it is external services or tools, and these can possibly be made by the PurrNet team, but won't be core to PurrNet. \
**Examples of these could be:**

* Full setups and integrations with other tools.
* Extensive/in-depth setups or templates
* Plug n' play tools
